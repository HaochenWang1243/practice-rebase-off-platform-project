origin is usually used as the name of the private fork-generated remote repo
upstrean is usually used as the name of the public repo we forked
we need to maually add the upstream remote using git remote add upstream [ssh url of the public repo]

git clone: Creates a local copy of a remote.
git remote -v: Lists a Git project’s remotes.
git fetch: Fetches work from the remote into the local origin branch.
git merge [branch_name]: merge the branch_name branch into the current branch. branch_name is giver and current branch is receiver (only receiver branch changes)
git merge origin/[branch_name]: Merges origin/[branch_name] branch into your local branch.
git pull:fetch + merge
git rebase [branch_name]: rebase current branch on branch_name. 
git push origin <branch_name>: Pushes the current branch to the origin('s corresponding branch).
git push  <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME> : push the local BRANCHNAME branch to REMOTENAME.


git checkout [branch_name]:go to [branch_name] branch
git branch [branch_name]:create [branch_name] branch
git -d [branch_name]:delete branch


merge conflict:
The merge was successful because master had not changed since we made a commit on fencing. Git knew to simply update master with changes on fencing.
What would happen if you made a commit on master before you merged the two branches? Furthermore, what if the commit you made on master altered 
the same exact text you worked on in fencing? When you switch back to master and ask Git to merge the two branches, 
Git doesn’t know which changes you want to keep. This is called a merge conflict.

pull request:
after pushing from local to the fork-generated repository(origin) in your own github account, can make pull requests on github
by clicking "contribute" in the repository main page to start a pull request to the forked public repository. The administrators will come and authorize/comment on the changes.



add a fetch & push stream of a public remote repo: git remote add upstream [ssh url of the public repo]

directly fetch updates from the remote repo into origin of the local repo(not the fork-generated one): git fetch upstram

update branch in fork-generated repo with the fetched information stored in local origin: git push origin master 
interpretation: from  local master branch   push to    origin master branch

directly pushing from local to the public repository: git push upstram master
